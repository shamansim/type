Very early, I wanted to use computer science to contribute in the field of biology. After 6 months at the RIKEN in Japan where I developped analyses for Single-Cell RNA-Seq data, I went to Germany at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research in Munich as a PhD Student. I am currently part of the Systems Neuroscience Group where I established a single-cell RNA sequencing experimental and bioinformatic pipeline. Almost every day now, I use scRNA-seq to provide insight on how the brains work in aging and disease.
