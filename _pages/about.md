I am passionate about leveraging computer science and technology to advance biological research, particularly in the fields of genomics. My journey began with a six-month research experience at RIKEN in Japan, where I developed advanced analyses for Single-Cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. This experience solidified my interest in bioinformatics and led me to pursue a PhD at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research in Munich, Germany.

As a PhD student in the Systems Neuroscience Group under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Özgün Gökçe, I established a comprehensive experimental and bioinformatics pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing. In addition to bioinformatics, I developed crucial molecular biology skills associated with single-cell technologies. This pipeline became the foundation of a core facility for the institute, the campus, and at the regional level through consortia, providing essential resources for ongoing research. Our team focused on unraveling how the brain functions in aging and disease, with a particular emphasis on immune cells and their interactions with other cell types.

Upon completing my PhD, I moved to France and joined the Curie Institute as a Research Engineer in the Custom Single Cell Omics platform. In this role, I continue to support cutting-edge research by providing expertise in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and proteomics, all through single-cell technologies.
