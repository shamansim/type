Very early, I wanted to use computer science to contribute to the field of biology. After 6 months at the RIKEN in Japan where I developed analyses for Single-Cell RNA-Seq data, I went to Germany at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research in Munich as a PhD Student. I am currently part of the Systems Neuroscience Group where I established a single-cell RNA sequencing experimental and bioinformatic pipeline. Almost every day now, I use scRNA-seq to provide insight into how the brain works in ageing and disease. I focus on the immune cells of the brain and its interactions with the other cell types.
